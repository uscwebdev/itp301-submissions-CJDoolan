					<h3> Shon Hiatt</h3>
					<p> Shon Hiatt, Associate Professor of Management and Organization, was recently quoted in @fooddive discussing food companies' claims to reduce carbon emissions. Shon, along with many sustainability groups, is skeptical about CPGs' ability to achieve net zero emissions. <br><br>

					<h3> Womens History Month</h3>
					<p> March is #WomensHistoryMonth! We are proud to celebrate the thousands of women who make our worldwide Marshall Family great, this month and always.⁠ <br><br>
					Think about the most influential woman you know. She's probably an innovator. She’s likely a communicator. She may be a leader. But she's definitely a trailblazer.
					We send a BIG SHOUT OUT to our female professors, staff, alumni, and students! USC Marshall Executive Education has many amazing women in our world. These women are pushing the bounds of society and educating business leaders to become the best they can be.
					 <br><br>
					During this month, it is important for us to take a moment to recognize the amazing contributions these women have made. Our company appreciates all that these women have done and looks forward to their continuing success.

					<h3> Employee appreciation day</h3>
					<p> Giving authentic recognition the right way is ideal. All people want is to be recognized or praised for their progress, positive actions, and recent contributions. Acknowledgment can instantly elevate company productivity and revenue. Unfortunately, according to a Gallup poll, 65 percent of employees claim to have received no recognition all year. <br><br>
					Take today to say thank you to all the people who work hard to support you.<br><br>
