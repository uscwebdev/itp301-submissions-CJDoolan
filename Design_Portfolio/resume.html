	 		<h1> About me! </h1>
	 		<p>Hello, my name is Christina Doolan. I am originally from Denver, CO, and I am currently a Sophomore majoring in Cognitive Science and minoring in both communication design and web development at the University of Southern California. I am highly interested in the development and design sides of marketing and am incredibly interested in pursuing a career in UX/UI design. I currently work for USC Marshall executive education as their design intern and am looking forward to continuing to expand my knowledge of this field. I am an active member of the American Marketing Association at my school, as well as on the design team for Innovation Design. Lastly, I am extremely active and adventurous which you can see through my executive board position on USC club track and my various other hobbies. </p>
